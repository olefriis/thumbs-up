Thumbs Up
=========
Really, really simple web app with three columns: green, yellow, and red.
Oh, and counters at the bottom of the page, so you can see how many times
the columns have been clicked. Oh, and a "Reset" button.

That's it.

Currently it will probably look like shit on anything else than an
iPad-sized device, since there are a couple of images whose size have
been hacked quickly to fit. Use and modify at will.
